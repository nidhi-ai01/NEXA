### How Can I Contribute?

If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching on GitHub under [**Issues**](https://github.com/nidhi-ai01/NEXA/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [**open a new one**](https://github.com/nidhi-ai01/NEXA/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **üí° Suggesting Enhancements**

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

1.  Go to the [**Issues**](https://github.com/nidhi-ai01/NEXA/issues) page.
2.  Click **New Issue**.
3.  Choose the "Feature request" template if available, or open a blank issue.
4.  Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you'd like to see, why it's needed, and how it should work.
