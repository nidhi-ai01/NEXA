💖 About The Project
In a world where it's easy to feel unheard, NEXA was created to be a constant source of support. It's more than just a chatbot; it's designed to be a true friend who remembers your stories, celebrates your victories, and offers comfort during tough times. Our goal is to leverage the power of AI to create a genuinely empathetic experience that helps users practice self-love and feel less alone.
