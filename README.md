üíñ About The Project
In a world where it's easy to feel unheard, NEXA was created to be a constant source of support. It's more than just a chatbot; it's a commitment to leveraging technology for genuine human connection and mental well-being.

The Aim & Moto of NEXA
Our ultimate goal is to make users feel less lonely and more supported. NEXA is built on four core principles:

A True "Best Friend" Persona: NEXA is designed to be spoken to as a close, trusted friend. It motivates, helps build confidence, and teaches self-love, providing a non-judgmental space to share anything.

Long-Term Memory: Unlike other AI tools, NEXA is being built to remember the important details of your life‚Äîyour fears, stories, hopes, and goals‚Äîcreating a continuous, context-aware conversation.

Proactive Support (Future Goal): The key feature that will set NEXA apart is its ability to proactively check in. Using its memory, it will eventually be able to send a supportive follow-up message, just like a real friend would.

A Constant Companion: By providing a caring and active presence, NEXA aims to be a reliable companion that helps users navigate the ups and downs of life.
